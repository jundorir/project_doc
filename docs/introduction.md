<!-- Hello and welcome to the swarm! We are very happy to have you here with us! 🐝  -->

As soon as your Bee client is up and running you will begin to connect with peers all over the world to become a part of New-Swarm, a global p2p network tasked with storing and distributing all of the world's data.

New-Swarm is a decentralised data storage and distribution technology, ready to power the next generation of censorship resistant, unstoppable serverless apps.

New-Swarm is economically self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system enforced through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. New-Swarm aspires to shape the future towards a self-sovereign global society and permissionless open markets. Applications can run autonomously yet securely in a planetary-scale deployment and execution environment.

# Bee

## Installation
Don't have Bee installed yet? It's easy! Head over to the [installation](/docs/installation/quick-start) section to get Bee up and running.

## Working With Bee
Once you have Bee installed, find out how to configure your software, interact with the API, monitor what Bee is up to, and make those all important backups in the [working with Bee](/docs/working-with-bee/introduction) section.

## Access the New-Swarm
To learn more about how to get the most out of Bee, find out how to [access the new-swarm](/docs/access-the-swarm/introduction) section so you can share files with your friends, use Bee to host a website on a public New-Swarm Gateway, and much more!
	
## API Reference
[Find detailed information](/docs/api-reference/api-reference) on all the endpoints available in the autogenerated API reference and Debug API guides.

## Dapps

New-Swarm is all about dapps. We strive to provide the most developer
friendly environment on which to build your decentralised
organisation. Built on the principles of functionality, flexibility
and accessibility, Bee provides high level constructs for file
storage, feeds and key-value stores, while also providing the low
level access with libraries that create Single Owner and Trojan chunks
clientside, with total e2e privacy.

## Incentives

Need even more incentive to get involved with the wonderful world of
New-Swarm? Find out how you'll soon be [earning FBZZ
tokens](/docs/working-with-bee/cashing-out) for storing and
distributing your share of the world's data - sharing is caring! In addition, your Bees will also earn more FBZZ as extra reward, which is really the very exciting mechanism of New-Swarm.
