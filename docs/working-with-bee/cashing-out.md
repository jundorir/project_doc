title: Cashing Out
id: cashing-out
---

As your Bee forwards and serves chunks to its peers, it is rewarded in
FBZZ in the form of cheques. Once these cheques accumulate sufficient
value, you may *cash them out* using Bee's API. This process transfers
money from your peer's chequebooks into your own, which you can then
withdraw to your wallet to do with as you please!

:::important
Do **not** cash out your cheques too regularly! Once a week is more
than sufficient! Besides the transaction costs, this prevents and
relieves unneccesary congestion on the blockchain. üí©

Bee contains a rich set of features to enable you to query the current accounting state of your node. First, let's query our node's current balance by sending a POST request to the balances endpoint.

```bash
curl localhost:11635/chequebook/balance | jq
```

```json
{
  "totalBalance": 10000000,
  "availableBalance": 9640360
}
```

It is also possible to examine your per-peer balances.

```bash
curl localhost:11635/balances | jq
```

```json
{
  "balances": [
    //...
    {
      "peer": "d0bf001e05014fa036af97f3d226bee253d2b147f540b6c2210947e5b7b409af",
      "balance": -85420
    },
    {
      "peer": "f1e2872581de18bdc68060dc8edd3aa96368eb341e915aba86b450486b105a47",
      "balance": -75990
    }
    //...
  ]
}
```

In New-Swarm, these per-peer balances represent trustful agreements between nodes. Tokens only actually change hands when a node settles a cheque. This can either be triggered manually or when a certain threshold is reached with a peer. In this case, a settlement takes place. You may view these using the settlements endpoint.

More info can be found by using the chequebook API.

```bash
curl localhost:11635/chequebook/cheque | jq
```

```json
{
  "totalreceived": 0,
  "totalsent": 718030,
  "settlements": [
    //...
    {
      "peer": "dce1833609db868e7611145b48224c061ea57fd14e784a278f2469f355292ca6",
      "received": 0,
      "sent": 89550
    }
    //...
  ]
}
```

As our node's participation in the network increases, we will begin to see more and more of these balances arriving. In the case that we have *received* a settlement from another peer, we can ask our node to perform the relevant transactions on the blockchain, and cash our earnings out.

To do this, we simply POST the relevant peer's address to the `cashout` endpoint.

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:11635/chequebook/cashout/d7881307e793e389642ea733451db368c4c9b9e23f188cca659c8674d183a56b
```

```json
{"transactionHash":"0xba7b500e21fc0dc0d7163c13bb5fea235d4eb769d342e9c007f51ab8512a9a82"}
```

You may check the status of your transaction using the [G√∂rli
Etherscan](https://goerli.etherscan.io/).

Finally, we can now see the status of the cashout transaction by sending a GET request to the same URL.

```bash
curl http://localhost:11635/chequebook/cashout/d7881307e793e389642ea733451db368c4c9b9e23f188cca659c8674d183a56b | jq
```

```json
{
  "peer": "d7881307e793e389642ea733451db368c4c9b9e23f188cca659c8674d183a56b",
  "chequebook": "0xae315a9adf0920ba4f3353e2f011031ca701d247",
  "cumulativePayout": 179160,
  "beneficiary": "0x21b26864067deb88e2d5cdca512167815f2910d3",
  "transactionHash": "0xba7b500e21fc0dc0d7163c13bb5fea235d4eb769d342e9c007f51ab8512a9a82",
  "result": {
    "recipient": "0x312fe7fde9e0768337c9b3e3462189ea6f9f9066",
    "lastPayout": 179160,
    "bounced": false
  }
}
```

Success, we earned our first FBZZ! üêù

Now we have earnt tokens, to withdraw our FBZZ from the chequebook contract back into our node's own wallet, we simply POST a request to the chequebook withdraw endpoint.

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:11635/chequebook/withdraw\?amount\=1000 | jq
```

And conversely, if we have used more services than we have provided, we may deposit extra FBZZ into the chequebook contract by sending a POST request to the deposit endpoint.

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:11635/chequebook/deposit\?amount\=1000 | jq
```

```json
{"transactionHash":"0xedc80ebc89e6d719e617a50c6900c3dd5dc2f283e1b8c447b9065d7c8280484a"}
```

You may then use [Blockscout](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet) to
track your transaction and make sure it completed successfully.

# Managing uncashed cheques

For the Bee process, the final step of earning FBZZ is cashing a
cheque. It is worth noting that a cheque is not yet actual FBZZs. In
Bee, a cheque, just like a real cheque, is a promise to hand over
money upon request. In real life, you would present the cheque to a
bank. In new-swarm life, we present the cheque to a smart-contract.

Holding on to a swap-cheque is risky; it is possible that the owner of
the chequebook has issued cheques worth more FBZZ than is contained in
their chequebook contract. For this reason, it is important to cash
out your cheques every so often.

With the set of API endpoints, as offered by Bee, it is possible to
develop a script that fully manages the uncashed cheques for you. As
an example, we offer you a [very basic
script](https://gist.github.com/ralph-pichler/3b5ccd7a5c5cd0500e6428752b37e975#file-cashout-sh),
where you can manually cash out all cheques with a worth above a
certain value. To use the script:

1. Download and save the script:

  ```bash
  wget -O cashout.sh https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ralph-pichler/3b5ccd7a5c5cd0500e6428752b37e975/raw/cashout.sh
  ```

2. Make the file executable:

  ```bash
  chmod +x cashout.sh
  ```

3. List all uncashed cheques and cash out your cheques above a certain value:

  - List:

    ```bash
    ./cashout.sh
    ```
  
    :::info
    If running ./cashout.sh returns nothing, you currently have no uncashed cheques.
    :::

  - Cashout all cheques:

    ```bash
    ./cashout.sh cashout-all
    ```

Are you a Windows-user who is willing to help us? We are currently
missing a simple cashout script for Windows. Please see the
[issue](https://github.com/newswarm-lab/new-bee/issues/1092).

You can find the officially deployed smart-contract by the New-Swarm team
in the [swap-swear-and-swindle
repository](https://github.com/ethersphere/swap-swear-and-swindle).

# Extra Reward

Your Bees will also earn more FBZZ as extra reward in the form of cheques in New-Swarm network.
This is really the very exciting added bonus part of New-Swarm, which provides healthy incentive mechanism and reliable guarantee of profits for Bees that work normally for DISC.
You can list all the uncashed bonus cheques and then cash them out via the following API. 

- List all uncashed bonus cheques:
  
  ```bash
  curl  http://localhost:11635/chequebook/bonusuncashedcheques
  ```

  ```json
  {
      "totaluncashedcheques":10,
      "totaluncashedamount":10000000000000000000,
      "bonusuncashedcheques": [
        //...
        {
          "beneficiary": "0xdBF7b29e1F6E2De250713099862257A8D961D23f",
          "chequebook": "-0xC72c02E6BA9953faDC13fdb2EaAC11aA3A0424a7",
          "amount":1000000000000000000
        }
        //...
      ]
    }
  ```

- Cash out the earliest uncashed bonus cheque:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:11635/chequebook/bonuscashout/uncashed
  ```

  ```json
  {"transactionHash":"0x68c04217765d224c62909cc47a54136ae01588df333fc7a16f1e8d24d95a8bc0"}
  ```

- Cash out all uncashed bonus cheques:
  ```bash
  This convinient feature is to be implemented and will be accessible soon.
  ```
