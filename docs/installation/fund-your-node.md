## Mainnet

Your Bee node needs FBZZ to be able to properly interact with the network. In order to receive these, you will need to acquire FBZZ, then bridge your FBZZ to the XDAI chain.

To bridge your xDai, you may use [omni bridge](https://omni.xdaichain.com/bridge). Please note that the address of the FBZZ token contract on xDai chain ([`0xdBF3Ea6F5beE45c02255B2c26a16F300502F68da`](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/tokens/0xdBF3Ea6F5beE45c02255B2c26a16F300502F68da/)) is different from that on the Ethereum chain.

To work out what your node's Ethereum address is, please consult your relevant installation guide or check your logs!


## Testnet

Your Bee node needs FBZZ to be able to properly interact with the test network. In order to receive these, you will need to sign into our Discord and request your FBZZ test tokens from the faucet channel, using your node's Ethereum address.

To work out what your node's Ethereum address is, please consult your relevant installation guide or check your logs!

Once you have determined your Ethereum address, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/t8VnJPzy) and navigate to the [#faucet](https://discord.gg/e39GQJsf) channel. It's very simple to use our Faucet Bot to get your test tokens.

Here you must **type** (not copy paste) the following, replacing the address with your own:

```
0xabeeecdef123452a40f6ea9f598596ca8556bd57
```

If you have problems, please let us know by making a post in the faucet channel, we will do our best to provide tokens to everyone.

Transactions may take a while to complete, please be patient. We're
also keen for you to join us in the new-swarm, and indeed you soon will!
