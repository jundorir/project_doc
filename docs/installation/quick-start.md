Bee is a versatile piece of software that caters for a diverse array of use cases. 

### Access the Network

If you want to interact with the Bee ecosystem in a decentralised way,
but not earn FBZZ by storing or forwarding chunks, simply run a Bee
[light node](/docs/access-the-swarm/light-nodes) in the background on
your laptop or desktop computer. This will enable direct access to the
new-swarm from your web browser and other applications.

[Install Bee](/docs/installation/install)

### Support the Network and Earn FBZZ by Running a Full Node

Earn [FBZZ](/docs/working-with-bee/cashing-out) and help keep the new-swarm
strong by running your own **full node**. It's easy to set up your own
Bee on a cloud
host or any home computer that's connected to the internet.

[Install Bee](/docs/installation/install)

<!-- ### Run Your Own Hive of Nodes -->

<!-- Take it to the next level by keeping a whole hive of Bees! We provide -->
<!-- tooling and monitoring to help you manage large deployments of -->
<!-- multiple Bee nodes: [Bee Hives](/docs/installation/hive). -->
